<p><em>Security Enthusist and Bugbounty Hunter <br><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30"><br><br>
 I am a Computer Engineer who is currently living in japan, who has a keen interest in Android Application Security and who enjoy doing bug bounties.

Coming to the practical implementation, I love making kotlin in android studio and tools in python to automate processes that take lots of time while pentesting Android applications and kenerl. On the way of doing that made me think to write blogs on the hunting Bugs so that I can share my experience with other enthusiasts
